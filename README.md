# Hi, I’m Cody

I build practical tools, experiments, and utilities — mostly in Go, Rust, Python, and whatever else fits the job.

Currently, I’m focused on creating high-performance CLI apps designed to help developers work smarter and faster.

Check out my repos below to see what I’m working on — some polished, some still in progress.
