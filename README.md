# Hi, I’m Cody

I build practical tools, experiments, and utilities — mostly in Go, Rust, Python, and whatever else fits the job.

Currently, I’m focused on creating high-performance CLI apps designed to help developers work smarter and faster.

Check out my repos below to see what I’m working on — some polished, some still in progress.

## Featured Projects

### Tools & CLI Apps
- [`marchat`](https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/marchat): Minimalist terminal-native group chat app with end-to-end encryption, plugin support, file sharing, and admin tools — built for speed, privacy, and extensibility (Go, Bubble Tea)
- [`marchat-plugins`](https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/marchat-plugins): Early-stage repo for marchat plugins, currently with a test echo plugin but planned to host official and community extensions for marchat’s growing plugin ecosystem
- [`ignoregrets`](https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/ignoregrets): Snapshots of your Git-ignored files tied to commits (Go)
- [`codesleuth`](https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/codesleuth): Fast COBOL code analysis and reporting (Rust + Go)
- [`parsec`](https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/parsec): Terminal file inspector with live preview and fuzzy search (Go)
- [`ascii-colorizer`](https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/ascii-colorizer): Render images and videos as full-color ASCII art (Python)
- [`.gothub`](https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/.gothub): Fragile infrastructure for emotionally unstable repos (Makefile, hooks, CI)
