# Hi, I’m Cody

I work with C++, Go, Python, JavaScript, Rust, Dart/Flutter — and whatever else fits the job.

I like building useful tools, experimenting with new ideas, and occasionally making games or interfaces just because it’s fun.

This profile is mostly a mix of side projects, experiments, and utilities — some polished, some still in progress.
