# Hi, Iâ€™m Cody

I work with a variety of languages and frameworks, including C++, Go, Python, JavaScript, Rust, and Dart/Flutter.  
I enjoy exploring modern tools and UI frameworks to build practical and meaningful projects.

This space is where I share my code, experiments, and ongoing learning.

Thanks for visiting.
