# Hi, I’m Cody    

I build high-performance CLI tools and terminal-native utilities in Go, Rust, and Python — designed to help developers work faster, with tools that respect the user's machine, time, and trust.    

I prefer software that works offline, fits in memory, and runs on five-year-old laptops. No frameworks for frameworks. No unnecessary cloud dependencies. Just clear, durable code that does the job.    

> Built to last, not to trend.
