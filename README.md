# Hi, I’m Cody

I build high-performance CLI and terminal-native utilities in Go, Rust, and Python. My tools respect your machine, time, and trust: fast, offline-first, and built to last.
I prefer software that works offline, fits in memory, and runs on five-year-old laptops. No frameworks for frameworks. No unnecessary cloud dependencies. Just clear, durable code that gets the job done.

> Built to last, not to trend.
